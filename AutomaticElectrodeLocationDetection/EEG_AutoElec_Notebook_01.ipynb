    "# **Automated 3D EEG Electrode Localization Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an end-to-end computational pipeline designed to automate the localization and labeling of EEG electrodes from 3D surface scans. By leveraging geometric feature extraction and density-based clustering, the system transforms raw mesh data into standardized anatomical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate electrode positioning is critical for source localization and reproducible EEG research. Traditionally, this process involves manual digitization, which is time-consuming and prone to inter-operator variability. This tool provides an automated digital pipeline that is both precise and scalable, achieving high spatial accuracy in electrode localization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, the methodologies implemented here align with established academic standards in the field, such as those discussed by Robert Oostenveld and colleagues (e.g., Giari et al., 2019, Journal of Neuroscience Methods), providing a robust validation for the pipeline's computational framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coordinate Alignment:** Rigid-body transformation of the raw scan into the RAS (Right-Anterior-Superior) coordinate system using anatomical fiducials (Nz, LPA, RPA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Feature Extraction:** Application of Gaussian Curvature analysis to identify local convexities corresponding to electrode sockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Density-Based Clustering:** Utilization of the DBSCAN algorithm to robustly isolate electrode sites from surface noise without prior knowledge of the channel count.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Warping:** Implementing Affine Transformations and Least Squares estimation to map detected centroids to the standard 10-20 system template.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** 3D Mesh file (e.g., .obj, .stl).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interaction:** User-guided selection of 5 reference points (Nz, LPA, RPA, Cz, Oz).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** Labeled electrode coordinates exported in a standard .txt format."

    "\n",
    "In this initial step, we import the necessary libraries for 3D mesh processing, spatial clustering, and mathematical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also define the **Electrode Template (masterdict)**. This dictionary contains the standardized coordinates for a 32-channel EEG layout in a generic space. These coordinates serve as our \"Gold Standard\" for the 10-20 system and will later be warped to fit the specific geometry of the subject's scanned head.\n",

    "\n",
    "At this stage, we have a cloud of candidate points that likely belong to electrodes. However, these are just individual points without any grouping. We use the **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** algorithm to organize these points into distinct electrode sites.\n",

    "### Why DBSCAN?\n",
    "Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN does not require us to specify the number of clusters (electrodes) beforehand. This is crucial because:\n",
    "* It can automatically identify an arbitrary number of electrodes based on the scan quality.\n",

    "* **`min_samples`:** The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point.\n",
    "* **Centroid Extraction:** Once clusters are identified, we calculate the **mean spatial coordinate (centroid)** for each cluster. This effectively reduces a cluster of hundreds of points into a single, precise `(x, y, z)` coordinate representing the center of an electrode.\n",
